## Structure
#### Heuristics
There are 4 heuristics:

1. `Aggregate Height` is the sum of all heights of columns on the board
1. `Complete Lines` is the sum of lines completed
1. `Holes` is the number of holes present on the board
1. `Bumpiness` is the difference in height between all adjacent columns

#### Implementation
The current implementation is a naive brute force algorithm (Greedy)
Max lines cleared: 634
